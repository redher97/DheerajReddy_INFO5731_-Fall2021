    "# Your answer here (no code for this question, write down your answer as detail as possible for the above questions):\n",
    "Research question: Multiple,Heterogenous data sources\n",
    "For some problems, we can collect lots of data from different data sources to improve our models and to increase knowledge. \n",
    "For example, we need to collect 3d depictions of cancer devolpment stages for calculating life expectancy\n",
    "\n",
    "The kind of data needed to be collected to answer is to take up different data sources of similar topic and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Extract and save Data from Multiple Sources:\n",
    "Extracting data from multiple sources is an involved process that requires contemplation and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Decide Which Sources to Use\n",
    "The first step is to identify which data you want to extract. \n",
    "This may be a more difficult question than it seems, depending on your goals and use cases. \n",
    "Note that your choice of data sources may evolve over time as your needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Choose the Extraction Method\n",
    "Depending on your needs, you may want to extract all of the data from a given data source every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Estimate the Size of the Extraction\n",
    "Once you’ve decided on the data sources to use, and the frequency with which you’ll perform the extraction, come up with an estimate of how much data will be extracted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Connect to the Data Sources\n",
    "Each data source may have its own API (application programming interface) or connector to help with the extraction process. If you can’t easily connect to a given data source, you may have to build a custom integration.\n",
