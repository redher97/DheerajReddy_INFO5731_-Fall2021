            "[\"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.\\n\\nSo why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.\\n\\nShang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.\\n\\nThe fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.\\n\\nThe first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.\\n\\nIn summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi.\", 'After 10 years of almost every movie being.armed combat, this one is fresh and the perfect start for phase 4 (yes, the start is with black widow but is something \"old\", too related to the previous phases), i loved every single moment, i got chills, i laughed. The soundtrack is astonishing, as the.cinematography. The best of the mcu if i may. Loved the colors. The fighting sequence leave you attached to the screen as they seem like they are dancing. All combined is something else, completely new and i can\\'t wait to see more of simu liu as shang-chi because he was.brilliant.\\n\\nGo see the movie!!', \"Perfect Fantasy film to watch with full family.. you can't miss this on big screen.\", \"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.\\n\\nI'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.\\n\\nThe story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing.

So, all told, it\\'s going to be \" A Completely Charmed, Fiery 9.50 Marks Out 10 From Me . . . . ROCK ON, MARVEL 👊 🔥❗\" .', 'Brought to you by the Truth Tellers.\\n\\nFilm is great overall and in this genre at least, is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre. Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU.\\n\\nLike many of the other Marvel Films in the MCU, they have to start somewhere. As an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action, decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh, fun and great characters. Definitely one to watch.\\n\\nFinal Verdict - Does what it is meant to do and provides the entertainment while doing it.', \"Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!\", \"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.\\n\\nBy far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.\\n\\nThe visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to.\", 'nan', \"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema.\", 'It\\'s a decent movie. Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn\\'t overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think \"oh it\\'s finishing up\" there\\'s more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it\\'s cool, nothing amazing or something you haven\\'t seen before.\\n\\nIf you\\'re familiar with marvel it\\'s the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).\\n\\nWanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie? This is one that you\\'ll like.', \"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.\\n\\nDisney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.\\n\\nThe acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.\\n\\nThere's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.\\n\\nI would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7\\n\\nThose review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.\", \"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.\\n\\nThe performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater.\", 'That was a freakin\\' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.\\n\\nThe whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.\\n\\nThe movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang\\'s culture is so rich.\\n\\nThe fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can\\'t help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.\\n\\nThere is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it\\'s made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!\\n\\nKiller soundtrack and the main song for the movie \"Run It\" fits so good with all.\\n\\nThere are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.\\n\\nAbout the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!\\n\\nFor sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it.', \"Shang-Chi was honestly amazing. The cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too. I am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds. To sum up my review I really enjoyed it and highly recommend. (stay for the credits to the end)\", 'nan', \"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame.\", \"This is well done as far as special effects but the plot is so boring I couldn't take it and left in the middle of the film.\", 'This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The hero of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience. Also the martial arts and action scenes are a treat to watch and the core of the film is about family.', 'Well the fight scenes were exciting , the story was incredibly slow. Not the best Marvel movie but not as weak as movies like Thor: The Dark World. Some of the best visuals in any movie I have seen which helps improve the overall experience. Keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!', \"The fight scenes, creature designs and set are absolutely amazing, but overall story was sort of slow. Visually stunning but yet I couldn't help but feel it's a bit overrated. It also felt less connected to the mcu than most Marvel films and the first Wong/ Abomination cameo felt very out of place.\", \"This movie is much better than black widow, it's funny, it's exciting, and full of adventure!\\n\\nMust see this summer!\", \"Martin Scorsese called most of these generic MCU movies theme park movies and This movie is perfect example of that. There are some great MCU movies, but seems like Marvel isn't even trying to separate themselves from theme park stigma, when they make movies like this.\", \"Overall it's nothing new or very creative. I have no idea why some people pretend like it's new coming of movies. It's not. It's meh at best. Wait for streaming!\", \"Another forgettable Marvel film, story is the same old but this time it's the asian version, I think the biggest issue is it's too long or else some of the action were good.\", 'Solid performances, some of the best action sequences in the MCU, visually stunning and likeable characters. This film is not only an achievement for a marvel film but also a film on its own.', \"As I stated in the title this is the 10th time I'm posting a review and it's probably going to be the 9th time it's reported by the large group of individuals trying to swing the ratings.\\n\\nIn any case this movie is what it is... it just so happens that what it is, is bad.\\n\\nThe writing is predictable. It's very far from traditional source material. Worst of all though is that it doesn't even feel connected to the MCU regardless of cameos.\\n\\nIt's like a studio that does one off summer action fillers has something over Kevin Feige and threatened to release it unless they got to do one.\\n\\nIt's also the only Marvel film I've ever seen two large groups of teenagers and young adults get up and leave around halfway through.\\n\\nAll in all it's been done so now at least it can be ticked off the list of Marvel studio obligations.\", 'nan', 'Extremely overrated movie for no reason at all. It doesn nothing new. Only thing marvel has left is Spider-Man right now. Everything else is just super meh.', \"Just an another amazing movie brought by MCU with adding a new character to marvel universe. Overall fantastic movie with the point of view of storyline and action sequences which really are one of the best among all marvel movies till now. It is clearly visible by this movie that there's something big planned by MCU in future which would be amazing to watch. At last just watch this movie you will love it.\", 'nan', 'The best amount of tension and humor, with a great storyline and great characters. LOVED IT.', 'The story is just not there! The acting was ok, the fighting scenes kinda meh but ok, but the story.. they messed up really bad! Really a bad bad movie from Marvel. Holding hands with Thor 2 and Captain Marvel.. the other reviews were definitely bought.', \"Shang Chi is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Destin Daniel Cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for the villain, Mandarin . Shang Chi is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene.\", \"Not worth watching or wasting your money on it. Some obvious fanboys are trying to hype it up, but it's not that good. If you like actual Martial Arts movies, i would recommend some older stuff from 70s.\", \"It's so extremely generic and made with no passion or soul in it. It's just another super generic origin story where main character is basically invincible and beats the bad guy and saves the day, so he could later join some Endgame style movie.\", 'Good in certain moments. And those moments were very few.', 'Very boring MCU movie, Suicide Squad was so much better, i would recommend watch this instead.', \"Overall it was a pretty bland movie. The plot was uninteresting and boring. There's not as many fight scenes as you'd think. Most of the characters didn't have a lot of personality. And Shang's girlfriend was incredibly annoying.\\n\\nIt had it's moments though. There's a certain character that brought some fun scenes to the film.\\n\\nIt's definitely one of the lower tier marvel movies, but it was still worth watching.\", 'nan', \"For a guy like me, that grown up watching Jackie Chan's kung fu movies, this film was a wonderful experience!\\n\\nBesides all the perfect fight scenes and amazing special effects the story telling was terrific, I was completely moved by Shang-Chi's story and his family's.\\n\\nAnd the ending was awesome as well! I don't have too much to say, just a wonderful feeling that this movie gave me!\", 'When the movie first started... I felt like I was watching a \"foreign\" film. No English just Chinese with English subtitle? Didn\\'t know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!\\n\\nThe storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.', \"I had very high expectations and Shang-Chi still blew me away. Definitely the best Marvel movie to date, the story was great. The villain wasn't boring and didn't have lame motives, the characters were well written, the music was fantastic and the fight scenes and special effects were amazing. It's also a very easy movie to understand and enjoy if you aren't very well versed in Marvel movies as it's Shang-Chi's introductory movie. Highly recommend.\", 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.\\n\\nSo much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.\\n\\nI really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi\\'s sister, played by Meng\\'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.\\n\\nI found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.\\n\\nBy the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology... I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new \"universe\" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.\\n\\nMarvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it\\'s all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it\\'s my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it\\'s a very pleasant feeling.\\n\\nThe energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.\\n\\nThe scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the \\'Grand Final\\' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.\\n\\nA jewel.', \"Although i watched hall print bt this movie was too good that i can't even blame the hall print.\", \"I left the theater almost speechless, I went in with pretty high expectations, As a Asian-American person I didn't really know what to expect from the MCU since it was really their first time introducing this type of culture and character into their franchise, but after seeing this it met all my expectations from the cinematography, to the lore of Chinese mythology and action. I hope this film gets the hype it deserves it ties in with the bigger MCU and leaves some mystery for the anticipation of more.\", \"This movie is it, the whole time I was in awe, everybody in the theater were. Don't read anything, watch it, it's worth the time and money and everything. Marvel outdid themselves. This is phase 4 people, this is it.\\n\\nFantastic directing, fantastic editing, fantastic CG, fantastic soundtrack. My expectations were surpassed. I recommend it to everyone.\", \"With no real concept of the character or the story, I didn't really know what to expect from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I was pleasantly surprised. This Marvel action film is above average, and features impressive visuals, engaging action scenes, and entertaining characters. There are some missing pieces in the story, which they may be saving for later, but overall, I enjoyed this introduction to a new MCU superhero.\", 'nan', \"Does everything the MCU does very well, a few of the things it does poorly, and then brings a whole lot of new elements to the universe. Incredibly enjoyable ride in theaters. At worse, you'll leave feeling like it was pretty good.\"]\n"

            "['Ill start by saying that if youre looking for a great story, youll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard heros journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles. So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels. Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon. The fight scenes are all amazing. Theres one weak fight, but its meant to be weak, and theyre all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing. The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off. In summary, the story is lacking, but Im glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi.']\n"
